# Open Web Platform

Web technology is very broad and interesting to learn, almost every day many new things are born there. Utilization of web technology has become a daily necessity, almost every profit and non-profit line of business is now using web technology that has been standardized by OWP.

But what is OWP? To be honest, of all the books on web programming that the author has read, none of them have written about OWP. Whereas OWP is the basic information that we must know first before getting to know the web world.

OWP stands for Open Web Platform, in which there is a collection of technologies developed with the concept of Open Standards by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and other standards-setting organizations (Standards Setting Organization or SSO) such as WHATWG (The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group), Unicode Consortium, IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), and Ecma International.

The term Open Web Platform itself was introduced by the W3C and in 2011 the CEO of W3C, Jeff Jaffe explained that:

> “OWP is a platform for innovation, consolidation and price efficiency.”
